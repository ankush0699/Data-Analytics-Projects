# AtliQ Grands Hospitality Project 
## Project Introduction

AtliQ Grands, a prominent name in the hospitality industry, has been operating multiple five-star hotels across India for the past 20 years. Despite their longstanding presence and reputation, AtliQ Grands has faced significant challenges recently, primarily due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making within the management. These issues have led to a noticeable decline in their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel sector.

In response to these challenges, the managing director of AtliQ Grands has decided to implement "Business and Data Intelligence" to reclaim their market position and revenue streams. As part of this strategic initiative, we have been tasked with leveraging data to drive actionable insights and support informed decision-making.

The objectives of this project are threefold:
1. Utilizing the provided sample data and mock-up dashboard, create metrics as outlined in the metric list.
2. Develop a comprehensive dashboard that aligns with the stakeholders' mock-up.
3. Generate additional relevant insights that go beyond the given metric list and mock-up dashboard.

This project aims to harness the power of data analytics to empower AtliQ Grands in their journey to regain their competitive edge in the hospitality industry.
